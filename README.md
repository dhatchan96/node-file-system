# Timestamp File Creator API

This is a simple Node.js and Express API that creates a `.txt` file with the current timestamp as its content. The file is stored in a designated folder on the server.

## Features

- **Create Timestamp File**: Generates a `.txt` file with the current timestamp when the endpoint is accessed.
- **Unique Filenames**: Each file name includes a unique timestamp for differentiation.
- **Automatic Folder Creation**: The folder for storing the timestamp files is created automatically if it doesnâ€™t exist.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v12 or higher)
- **npm**

## Getting Started
